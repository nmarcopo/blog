This is Nick's blog. He posts some of his cool experiences with tech here from time to time.

Check out [his website](https://nick.marcopo.li) and [his GitHub](https://git.io/nmarcopo).

This blog was made with the [daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) theme for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It used to be just a basic HTML site but Nick got sick of writing articles without Markdown formatting.
